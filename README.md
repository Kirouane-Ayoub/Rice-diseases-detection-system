About Dataset :
This is the dataset used by me and my thesis mates when we created a Image Recognition application. they are sorted by diseases and labeled using Labelimg

We covered the following diseases for rice plants:

1/ Bacterial Leaf Blight ( BLB )

2/ Blast

3/ Brown spot

The datasets provided here are of optimium age (3 to 4 weeks). this is because a disease that is too old or too young cannot be accurately detected. it would need additional data to do so (weather,water sample,leaf sample tests,etc)
